# Improving Sensor Data Reliability in Vibration-Based Structural Health Monitoring Using Sensor-to-Sensor Cross-Validation

## Short Description:
Long-term vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) systems increasingly rely on low-cost MEMS-based smart sensors. While these sensors enable dense deployments, their long-term reliability is often uncertain due to aging, environmental effects, or hardware faults, which can lead to incorrect condition assessments. This talk presents a method to improve sensor data reliability by enabling wireless sensor-to-sensor cross-validation in SHM networks. Multiple vibration sensors installed on a structure, such as a railway bridge, periodically compare their frequency-domain characteristics. By analyzing and cross-checking FFT-based vibration signatures between neighboring sensors, abnormal sensor behavior can be identified independently of actual structural changes. This approach allows continuous monitoring of both the structure and the health of the sensing system itself, increasing confidence in SHM decisions and reducing false alarms.

## Detailed Description:
Vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) is widely used for critical infrastructure such as railway bridges, where early detection of damage is essential for safety and maintenance planning. Modern SHM systems increasingly employ low-cost MEMS-based smart vibration sensors due to their compact size, low power consumption, and ability to form dense wireless sensor networks. However, when such sensors are deployed for long durations in real-world environments, their reliability becomes a critical concern. Sensor drift, mounting degradation, environmental exposure, power-related issues, or internal hardware faults can result in incorrect or misleading vibration data. In practice, this can lead to false alarms or, more critically, missed damage detection.

This talk focuses on improving the reliability of sensor data in vibration-based SHM by introducing a sensor-to-sensor cross-validation strategy. Instead of assuming each sensor operates correctly throughout its lifetime, the proposed approach enables sensors to periodically validate their measurements against neighboring sensors installed on the same structure. The core idea is that while structural changes affect the vibration response of the entire system in a consistent manner, sensor faults typically manifest as localized or inconsistent anomalies.

In the proposed framework, multiple MEMS-based smart sensors are installed along a railway bridge and communicate wirelessly. At defined intervals, sensors exchange processed vibration features rather than raw data to minimize communication and power requirements. Frequency-domain features derived from FFT analysis, such as dominant frequencies and spectral amplitudes, are compared between sensors that experience similar structural excitation. Significant deviations between sensors, beyond expected structural variability, are interpreted as indicators of potential sensor malfunction rather than structural damage.

The talk will discuss how this approach enables simultaneous monitoring of both the structure’s condition and the sensing system’s health. Practical aspects such as feature selection, comparison thresholds, wireless communication constraints, and robustness to operational and environmental variability will be addressed. Experimental or simulated examples will be used to illustrate how faulty sensor behavior can be distinguished from genuine structural changes.

By embedding sensor self-validation into SHM networks, the proposed method increases trust in long-term monitoring data, reduces maintenance effort, and enhances decision-making reliability. The approach is particularly suited for large-scale infrastructure monitoring, where manual sensor inspection is impractical and system-level robustness is essential.
